# Smart Health Prediction System


## Overview
The Smart Health Prediction System is a web-based application designed to predict various chronic health disorders, including cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, liver issues, and kidney problems. The system utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze symptoms and provide early predictions.

## Key Features
- Disease Prediction Model: A machine learning and deep learning model capable of predicting a range of chronic health disorders.
- Web Application: An intuitive web interface that allows users to input symptoms and receive predictions from the developed model.
- User-Friendly: The system is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible for individuals without a technical background.

## Technologies and Stacks Used
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning:**
  - Developed the disease prediction model using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
- **Web Development:**
  - Built the web application using Flask as the backend framework.
  - Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deployed the application on Heroku platform for accessibility.

## How it Works
1. **Input Symptoms:**
   - Users input their symptoms into the web application.
2. **Prediction Engine:**
   - The system processes the symptoms using the disease prediction model.
3. **Prediction Output:**
   - Users receive predictions about potential chronic health disorders based on the provided symptoms.

## Project Structure
- **/models:** Contains the machine learning and deep learning models.
- **/web_app:** Includes the Flask application files for the web interface.
- **/data:** Includes datasets for each diseases used for training the prediction model.
